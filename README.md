# Predictive-analysis-of-Netflix-stock-data
In this project predictive and regression analysis was carried out on historical Netflix data ( 1-Jan-2020 until 29-May-2020).
Data was loaded and explored.
LSTMs and RNN methods were used to carry out regression and predictive analysis of the data. 
In the end, real and predicted stock prices were visualized.

Analysis covered :

* Importing Needed packages
* Understanding the Data
* Data Exploration
* Using RNN and LSTM 
* Creating train and test dataset
* Fitting the training data to the modeled regressions

We can see the fluctuation in the real stock price while our model also predicted a similar trend in the stock price. This clearly shows how powerful LSTMs are for analyzing time series and sequential data.
